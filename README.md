# Scene-image-classification-using-CNN
 In this notebook I have shown how a simple CNN is implemented on a multiclass image classification problem. I have covered  1. How to create a CNN Model and Train it.  2. How to evaluate the model on test set using different classification metrics.  3. How to visualize the images present in the training and test set.
